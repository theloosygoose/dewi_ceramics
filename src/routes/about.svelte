I am currently a Philadelphia based artist, ceramicist, and geoscientist. 
Recently I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Geology and Physics from 
Bates College in Maine. Art has always been a way to settle my mind and a 
method of expression whether its watercoloring, printmaking, writing poetry, 
creating ceramic pieces, or movement. The process of ceramics has always captivated me. 
It’s a balance of control in the making and constructing, contrasted by the unknown of the firing. 
I have found that welcoming failure to become part of the experience of making, allows for 
the unexpected to occur and the ability to dive deeper into my work. My process of endeavoring 
a project as an artist is analogous to my process as a geoscience researcher. Both come down to 
a circular practice of thinking and doing. It’s a loop of gathering information then discovering 
how it fits into a larger context. My work consists of functional utilitarian ware. I hope to 
bring intentionally handmade objects into the home to be incorporated into people’s daily rituals, 
to create more intimacy with life. Do you need a mug for your morning coffee or teatime? A bowl for 
a home cooked meal? A vase for that flower you picked on your daily hot girl walk? Ceramics to 
me is the intersection of art and everyday life.
